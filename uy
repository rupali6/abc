Few facts :
According to the World Bank’s latest report nearly 1.7 billion people are unbanked globally.
[13/11, 10:50 pm] Happy HERHACK HSBC: A recent study by the British research platform Merchant Machine revealed that Morocco, Vietnam, Egypt, Philippines and Mexico top the list of the most unbanked countries in the world with more than 60% of their population unbanked.  A global comparison by Global Finance (2021) saw that in the Middle East and Africa 50% of the population is financially excluded, with South and Central America nearing 38%, Eastern Europe at 33% and Asia Pacific at 24%. While these are significantly large portions of the population that are financially excluded, the world’s most developed regions are still not perfect role models – the proportion of financially excluded reaches about 21% in North America
[13/11, 10:57 pm] Happy HERHACK HSBC: The number of people without bank accounts due to regional language barriers can vary significantly based on factors such as geographical location, socio-economic conditions, and government initiatives. Accurate and up-to-date data on this specific issue is often challenging to obtain.

Financial inclusion efforts, including the promotion of regional language support in banking services, can play a crucial role in reducing such barriers. If you have a specific region or country in mind, I recommend checking reports from financial institutions, government agencies, or international organizations that focus on financial inclusion to gather more precise information on the current status of regional language barriers affecting access to banking services.


Implementing regional language solutions in banks can address several challenges and improve overall accessibility. Here are some potential benefits:

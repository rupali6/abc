## Solution Design and Approach Document: Automatic Video Translation and Subtitling

### 1. Proposed Solution:
1.1 Application Design:
The proposed solution is a web-based application that automates video translation and subtitling. Users will upload videos in one language and select the desired target language. The application will utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) technologies to convert the audio into text and translate it. Subtitles will be generated based on the translated text and synchronized with the video. The final output will be a translated video with subtitles.

**Technical Stack:**
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Python, Django (web framework)

1.2 Technical Design:
The architecture of the solution comprises several components that work together to achieve the desired outcome:

**Component Overview:**
1. User Interface: Provides an interface for users to upload videos and select translation options.
2. Video Processing: Extracts audio from uploaded videos using video processing libraries such as FFmpeg or OpenCV.
3. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Transcribes the audio into text using an ASR system like Mozilla DeepSpeech or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
4. Machine Translation (MT): Translates the transcribed text into the target language using a pre-trained machine translation model like Google Translate or OpenAI's translation models.
5. Subtitle Generation: Generates subtitles based on the translated text using libraries like pydub or ffmpeg-python.
6. Video Synthesis: Combines the translated audio, subtitles, and original video to produce the final translated video using video processing libraries.

**Data Flow:**
1. User uploads a video through the User Interface.
2. The Video Processing component extracts the audio from the video.
3. The ASR component transcribes the audio into text.
4. The MT component translates the transcribed text into the target language.
5. The Subtitle Generation component generates subtitles based on the translated text.
6. The Video Synthesis component combines the translated audio, subtitles, and original video to create the final translated video.

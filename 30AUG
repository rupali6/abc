Absolutely! Let's break down the query step-by-step to understand how it works in detail.

Updated Oracle SQL Query
Here is the query again:

sql
Copy code
SELECT id 
FROM your_table t1
WHERE isTrue = 'Yes' -- Ensure isTrue is 'Yes'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM (
        SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR(t1.nameId, '[^ ]+', 1, LEVEL) AS value
        FROM DUAL
        CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')) + 1
    ) sub
    WHERE value IN (SELECT TO_CHAR(id) FROM your_table)
);
Detailed Explanation
1. Main Query: Selecting id from your_table
sql
Copy code
SELECT id 
FROM your_table t1
SELECT id: Selects the id column from the table your_table.
FROM your_table t1: References your_table and assigns it an alias t1 for easier reference within the query.
2. Filter Condition for isTrue Column
sql
Copy code
WHERE isTrue = 'Yes'
WHERE isTrue = 'Yes': Filters the rows so that only those where the isTrue column has the value "Yes" are selected.
3. NOT EXISTS Subquery: Check if Extracted Values Exist in id Column
sql
Copy code
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM (
        SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR(t1.nameId, '[^ ]+', 1, LEVEL) AS value
        FROM DUAL
        CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')) + 1
    ) sub
    WHERE value IN (SELECT TO_CHAR(id) FROM your_table)
)
NOT EXISTS: Ensures that no rows from the subquery match the condition. If any match is found, the current row from your_table (t1) will be excluded from the results.
4. Innermost Subquery: Split the nameId Column into Separate Values
sql
Copy code
SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR(t1.nameId, '[^ ]+', 1, LEVEL) AS value
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')) + 1
REGEXP_SUBSTR(t1.nameId, '[^ ]+', 1, LEVEL): Extracts one value at a time from the nameId column.

REGEXP_SUBSTR: A regular expression function that extracts substrings from a string.
t1.nameId: Refers to the nameId column from your_table.
'[^ ]+': A regular expression pattern that matches any sequence of characters that are not a space ([^ ]+ means "any character except space, one or more times").
1: Start position for searching within nameId.
LEVEL: A pseudo-column in Oracle that represents the current level in a hierarchical query. Here, it is used to sequentially extract each value from the nameId field.
FROM DUAL: Oracle's dummy table, which is used when a query needs to return a value without requiring any specific table.

CONNECT BY LEVEL <= LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')) + 1:

CONNECT BY: Creates a hierarchical query; LEVEL represents the depth of the recursion.
LEVEL <= LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')) + 1:
LENGTH(t1.nameId): Calculates the total length of the nameId string.
REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', ''): Removes all spaces from nameId.
LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')): Calculates the length of nameId without spaces.
LENGTH(t1.nameId) - LENGTH(REPLACE(t1.nameId, ' ', '')): Computes the number of spaces in nameId.
+ 1: Adds 1 to get the total number of values in the space-separated string (since there is always one more value than the number of spaces).
5. Subquery Alias sub and Filter Using IN Clause
sql
Copy code
) sub
WHERE value IN (SELECT TO_CHAR(id) FROM your_table)
) sub: Assigns an alias sub to the subquery generating individual values from the nameId column.
WHERE value IN (SELECT TO_CHAR(id) FROM your_table): Checks if the extracted value exists in the id column of your_table.
TO_CHAR(id): Converts the id column to a character type (string) to match the type of value.
Summary of the Query
Selects rows where isTrue = 'Yes'.
Extracts each space-separated value from the nameId field.
Checks if none of the extracted values are found in the id column.
Returns only the ids that meet these criteria.
Final Result
This query will return IDs 4 and 6, where:

ID 4: The values 45, 658, 008 in nameId are not present in the id column.
ID 6: The values 90, 87 in nameId are not present in the id column.
These IDs also have isTrue = 'Yes'.
